What are the different approaches to clustering?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cost-based clustering\\
	Find minimum cost partition. $k$-means (minimize sum of squared distances), $k$-median (minimize sum of distances, centers from data), fuzzy $k$-means (aims to minimize the weighted sum of squared distances), $k$-medoids (Partitioning Around Medoids). \\
	All the algorithms are some variants of local search heuristics.
	\item Hierarchical clustering\\
	Start with every point in its own cluster. Merge till one cluster remains. Common ways to merge, single-linkage, max-linkage, avg-linkage.
	\item Spectral clustering\\
	Let $L = D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$ (where $A$ is adjacency matrix). Find top $k$ eigenvalues of this matrix and cluster using $k$-means.\\
	There are relations between these and kernel PCA.
\end{itemize}
Some recent work on cost-based hierarchical clustering.
