\section{Learning mixtures of gaussians}

Given a distribution of mixture of $k$ gaussians in $R^d$. Estimate the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ of these gaussians. Given a sample of size $n$ generated according to the distribution.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sanjoy Dasgupta, {\em Learning mixtures of gaussians. [Das99]}\\
	Algorithm based on random projections\\
	Recovers the centers of the gaussians when the separation is $\sigma \sqrt d$.\\
	The number of samples required is $n = k^{O(1)}$.
	
	\item Sanjoy Dasgupta and Leonard Schulman, {\em A probabilistic analysis of em for mixtures of separated, spherical gaussians [DS07]} \\
	Analyze the performance of the EM algorithm when the data is generated by a mixture of $k$-gaussians.\\
	Recovers the centers of the gaussians when the separation is $\sigma d^{\frac{1}{4}}$.\\
	The number of samples depend on parameters of the distribution.
	
	\item Sanjeev Arora and Ravi Kannan, {\em Learning mixtures of separated nonspherical Gaussians [AK05]}\\
	Reduce the separation required to learn a mixture of gaussians to $d^{\frac{1}{4}}$ in the spherical case.\\
	They construct an algorithm.
	
	\item Santosh Vempala and Grant Wang, {\em A spectral algorithm for learning mixtures of distributions [VW02]}\\
	Propose a spectral algorithm for the problem.\\
	When the distribution is spherical, separation required is only $\|\mu_i - \mu_j\| \ge C \max \{\sigma_i, \sigma_j \} k^{\frac{1}{4}}\log^{\frac{1}{4}}d$
	
	\item Dimitris Achlioptas and Frank McSherry, {\em On spectral learning of mixtures of distributions [AM05]}\\
	Algorithm based on combining spectral projection with single-linkage.\\
	Recovers mixture of gaussians when separation is $4\sigma_i(k\log Mk + k^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ where $M >> k(d+ \log k)/w_{min}$
	
	\item Amit Kumar and Ravindran Kannan, {\em Clustering with spectral norm and the k-means algorithm [KK10]}\\
	Analyze the convergence of the Llyod's algorithm\\
	Show convergence when the separation is $k \times radius$.
